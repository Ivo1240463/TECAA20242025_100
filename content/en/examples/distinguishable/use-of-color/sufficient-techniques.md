## Situation A:
If the color of particular words, backgrounds, or other content is used to indicate information

### Ensuring that information conveyed by color differences is also available in text

#### Example: A color-coded schedule

The schedule for sessions at a technology conference is organized into three tracks. Sessions for Track 1 are displayed over a blue background. Sessions in Track 2 are displayed over a yellow background. Sessions in Track 3 are displayed on a green background. After the name of each session is a code identifying the track in text: T1 for Track 1, T2 for Track 2, and T3 for Track 3.

## Situation B:
If color is used within an image to convey information

### Using color and pattern

#### Examples:
- A real estate site provides a bar chart of average housing prices in several regions of the United States. The bar for each region is displayed with a different solid color and a different pattern. The legend uses the same colors and patterns to identify each bar.
- An online map of a transportation system displays each route in a different color. The stops on each route are marked with a distinctive icon such as a diamond, square, or circle to help differentiate each route.
