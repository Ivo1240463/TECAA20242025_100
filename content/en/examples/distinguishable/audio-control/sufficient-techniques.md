## Playing a sound that turns off automatically within three seconds

### Examples:
- A web page opens with a trumpet fanfare and then goes silent
- A homepage opens with the chairman saying "Binfor, where quality is our business." then going silent.

## Providing a control near the beginning of the Web page that turns off sounds that play automatically

### Examples:
- A web page contains a time-based media presentation that includes an audio track as well as an animated video describing how to repair a lawnmower engine. The page contains 2 buttons that say "Pause" and "Stop", which give the user control over when and if the time-based media plays.
- A web page contains an embedded short film. The page contains a button that says "Pause the movie", which allows the user to pause the film.
