## Failure due to identifying content only by its shape or location

### Examples:
- The navigation instructions for a site state, "To go to next page, press the button to the right. To go back to the previous page, press the button to the left."
- A user is reading a news article in an online newspaper. The article contains an illustration and additional links for more information. Within the text of the article is a statement, "Please see sidebar to the left of the illustration for links to additional information." An assistive technology user would have difficulty finding the illustration and the sidebar. Some alternatives would be to include the list of links within the text; to provide an in-page link within the text which links to the sidebar; to provide a heading for the sidebar which can be used for navigation and refer to the heading in the instructions.
- A user is completing an online survey. There are three buttons at the bottom of the survey form. The instructions state, "Press the square button to exit the survey without saving, Press the triangle button to save in-progress survey results. You may return later to complete the survey. Press the round button to submit the survey results." A screen reader user or a user unable to distinguish shapes cannot determine which button is square, triangular, or round. The buttons must have additional information to indicate their functions or their shapes.

## Failure due to using a graphical symbol alone to convey information

### Example: Glyphs Used to Indicate Status
A shopping cart uses two simple glyphs to indicate whether an item is available for immediate shipment. A circle indicates that the item is in stock and ready to ship. A square indicates that the item is currently on back order and not available for immediate shipment. The instructions above items refer to the circle and square as the sole means of differentiating whether an item is available.
