## Failure due to using text alternatives that are not alternatives (e.g., filenames or placeholder text)

### Examples of text that are not text alternatives include:
- placeholder text such as " " or "spacer" or "image" or "picture" etc that are put into the 'text alternative' location on images or pictures.
- programming references that do not convey the information or function of the non-text content such as "picture 1", "picture 2" or "0001", "0002" or "Intro#1", "Intro#2".
- filenames that are not valid text alternatives in their own right such as "Oct.jpg" or "Chart.jpg" or "sales\\oct\\top3.jpg".

## Failure due to providing long descriptions for non-text content that does not serve the same purpose or does not present the same information

### Example:
An image showing the locations of venues for events at the Olympic Games displayed on a street map. The image also contains an icon for each type of sporting event held at each venue. The long description states, "Map showing the location of each Olympic venue. Skating, hockey and curling are held at the Winter Park Ice Arena, Downhill skiing and jumping are held at Snow Mountain, Gymnastics is held at the JumpUp Arena, Cross Country Skiing is held at the Kilometer Forest". While this description provides useful information, it does not convey the same information as the image because it provides no specific location information such as the address or the distance of each location from some fixed point. Note that long descriptions do not always need to be in prose form; sometimes the information may best be presented in a table or other alternate format.
