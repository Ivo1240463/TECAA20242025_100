## Providing open (always visible) captions

### Examples:
- In order to ensure that everyone can view their online movies, even if users do not know how to turn on captions in their media player, a library association puts the captions directly into the video.
- A news organization provides open captions on all of its material.

## Providing closed captions using any readily available media format that has a video player that supports closed captioning

### Examples:
- In order to ensure that users who are deaf can use their interactive educational materials, the college provides captions and instructions for turning on captions for all of their audio interactive educational programs.
- The online movies at a media outlet all include captions and are provided in a format that allows embedding of closed captions.
