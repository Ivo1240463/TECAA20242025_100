## Failure due to captions omitting some dialogue or important sound effects

Examples of text streams that are not captions include:

- text that contains the dialogue (possibly simplified dialogue) but that does not describe important sounds
- text that omits dialogue during portions of the material

## Failure due to not labeling a synchronized media alternative to text as an alternative

### Example: Synchronized media alternatives provided elsewhere on page

A page with instructions to complete a tax form provides a prose description of the fields to complete, data to provide, etc. Additionally, a synchronized media alternative provides spoken instructions, with video of a person completing the section being discussed in the audio. Although both versions are provided on the page, the synchronized media version is provided elsewhere on the page and is not clearly labeled with the part of the text for which it is a substitute. This makes it difficult for users encountering the text to find it, and users encountering the video do not know where its text alternative is.
