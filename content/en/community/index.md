## Context

This documentation website was developed as part of the course unit "Technologies to Support Learning" (TECA), offered by the Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto (ISEP).  
<br>
The project involved creating a website that illustrates one of the POUR principles, in this case, the "Perceivable" principle, with features compliant with Level A.  
<br>
To put the principles into practice, this website also aims to align with various guidelines described across all four POUR principles.
