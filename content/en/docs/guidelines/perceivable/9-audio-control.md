## Audio Control

When audio plays automatically on a webpage, it is essential that users can control it. This is particularly important if the audio plays for more than 3 seconds. Users should be able to pause, stop, or adjust the volume independently from the overall system volume level, ensuring a more comfortable browsing experience, particularly for users with hearing impairments or those who need a quieter environment.

## General Rule

If any audio on a webpage plays automatically for more than 3 seconds, one of the following mechanisms must be available:

- A mechanism to pause or stop the audio
- A mechanism to control the audio volume independently from the overall system volume level.

This ensures that users are not forced to listen to unwanted or intrusive sounds without the ability to adjust or mute them.

## Specific Situations

### Autoplaying Audio
If audio starts playing automatically when a page loads, ensure that users can pause or stop it within 3 seconds. Provide clear controls for stopping or muting the sound.

### Volume Control
If the audio cannot be paused or stopped, provide an option to control the volume independently of the system's overall volume. This is especially important for audio in media players or embedded content like podcasts, videos, or background sounds.

### Long-Form Content
For longer content like podcasts or background music, ensure users have easy access to audio controls. Consider adding buttons for play/pause, stop, and volume adjustment.

### Notification Sounds
For notifications or alerts that play audio automatically, provide a method for users to turn off or adjust the volume of these sounds.
