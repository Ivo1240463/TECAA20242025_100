## Non-text Content

Ensuring that all non-text content has an appropriate text alternative is crucial for making content accessible to users with disabilities. This guideline ensures that users who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise unable to perceive non-text content can still access and understand it.

All non-text content presented to the user must have a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose, except in specific situations outlined below.

## General Rule

All non-text content must have a text alternative that provides the same information or functionality, except in the following specific cases:

- Controls and Input
- Time-Based Media, like a video or audio
- Test Content
- Sensory Content
- CAPTCHA
- Decoration, Formatting, Invisible Content

## Specific Situations

### Controls & Input
If non-text content acts as a control or accepts user input, it must have a name that clearly describes its function.

### Time-Based Media
For time-based media, for example a video or audio, text alternatives should at least provide a descriptive identification of the content. 

### Test Content
If non-text content is part of a test or an exercise that cannot be presented in text without invalidating the purpose, then descriptive identification is sufficient.

### Sensory Content
For non-text content primarily designed to create a sensory experience, a descriptive text alternative should be provided.

### Captcha
When CAPTCHA is used to differentiate between human users and automated systems, descriptive text alternatives must explain its purpose. Additionally, alternative CAPTCHA forms should accommodate different disabilities.

### Decorative & Formatting Elements
Non-text content that is purely decorative, used only for formatting, or is invisible to users should be implemented in a way that allows assistive technologies to ignore it.
