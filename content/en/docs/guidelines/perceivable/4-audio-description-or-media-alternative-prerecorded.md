## Audio Description or Media Alternative (Prerecorded)

To ensure accessibility for users who are blind or visually impaired, it is important to provide an alternative to visual content in multimedia. This can be achieved by offering either an audio description of the video content or a full text-based alternative that conveys the same information.

Audio descriptions narrate key visual elements such as actions settings, or on-screen text, that are important for understanding the content but are not conveyed through dialogue alone.

## General Rule

An audio description or alternative for time-based media must be provided for all prerecorded video content in synchronized media, unless:

- The media is a media alternative for text
- It is clearly labeled as such

The alternative should convey all essential visual information needed to understand the purpose and message of the media.

## Specific Situations

### Audio Description
If the video includes essential visual content not described in the dialogue, an audio description must be provided â€” either as part of the main audio track or as an alternative version.

### Media Alternative for Text
If the video is already serving as a media alternative for text for exam+le, a video version of a written article, and this is clearly labeled, then additional audio description or transcript is not required.
