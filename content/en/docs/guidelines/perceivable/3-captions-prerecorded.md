## Captions for Prerecorded Media

Captions provide a text alternative for the audio portion of synchronized media, making video content accessible to individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. This includes not just spoken dialogue, but also relevant sounds like music, laughter, or sound effects that contribute to the understanding of the content.

Providing captions ensures that all users can fully access and comprehend the information conveyed through audio in prerecorded multimedia.

## General Rule

All prerecorded audio content in synchronized media must have captions, unless the media is:

- A media alternative for text, and
- It is clearly labeled as such.

Captions should be accurate, synchronized with the audio, and include speaker identification and non-speech information when necessary.

## Specific Situations

### Spoken Dialogue
All spoken words in the audio track must be included in the captions. This includes conversations, narration, interviews, and any other form of speech.

### Non-Speech Sounds
Important sounds like laughter, applause, music cues, or sound effects that contribute to the understanding of the content should be captioned using descriptive text.

### Multiple Speakers
Captions should indicate when different people are speaking. Use speaker names or identifiers to clarify who is talking.

### On-Screen Text
If relevant information is presented on screen and not mentioned in the audio, it may be helpful to include it in the captions to ensure full comprehension.

### Language and Clarity
Captions should reflect the spoken content accurately, including grammar and tone. If the audio includes slang or unclear speech, captions should clarify without changing the meaning.

### Captions Not Required
If the video is explicitly labeled as a media alternative for text, and that article contains all of the same information, captions are not required.
