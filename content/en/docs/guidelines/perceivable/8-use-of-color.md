## Use of Color

Color should not be the only visual means of conveying important information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing visual elements. Relying solely on color can exclude users with color blindness or low vision.

To ensure accessibility, information conveyed by color must also be communicated through other means, such as text labels, patterns, or shapes.

## General Rule

Color should not be used as the only method for conveying information, including:

- Indicating actions for example, clicking a button
- Prompting a response for example error messages
- Distinguishing visual elements for example, form fields and links.

Where color is used, ensure that there is also another visual clue that has the same meaning.

## Specific Situations

### Links and Buttons
When using color to indicate clickable elements, ensure that there is a text label or underlined text to distinguish them, so users who cannot perceive color can still interact with the elements.

### Error Messages
If errors are highlighted using color, also use text or icons to clearly communicate the issue, such as "Please enter a valid email address" or an exclamation mark icon.

### Charts and Graphs
In charts or graphs, where color is used to differentiate between data sets, provide patterns or labels in addition to color.

### Form Fields
When indicating required form fields, do not rely solely on color. Instead, include a text label like ("*Required") or an icon to make it clear for users who cannot perceive the color.

### Notifications
If a notification uses color to grab attention, ensure that the notification also includes textual information or icons to indicate the message's meaning.
