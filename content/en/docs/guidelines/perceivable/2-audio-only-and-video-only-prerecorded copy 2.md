## Audio-only and Video-only (Prerecorded)

For users who cannot perceive audio or video content, it is essential to provide alternatives that convey the same information. This guideline ensures that prerecorded audio-only and video-only media are accessible to individuals with sensory impairments.

For prerecorded audio-only and prerecorded video-only media, text or alternative media must be provided, unless the content serves as a media alternative for text and is clearly labeled as such.

## General Rule

For prerecorded audio-only and video-only media, an equivalent alternative must be provided, as outlined below:

- Prerecorded Audio-only: An alternative form of time-based media that presents equivalent information must be provided for prerecorded audio content.
- Prerecorded Video-only: An alternative form of time-based media or an audio track must be provided that contains equivalent information for prerecorded video content.

## Specific Situations

### Prerecorded Audio-only
For prerecorded audio content, provide an alternative that presents equivalent information to ensure that users who cannot hear the audio can still access the same information. This could include transcripts, captions, or descriptive audio.

### Prerecorded Video-only
For prerecorded video content with no audio, provide either:

- An audio track that describes the content
- A text-based alternative.

The alternative should have the same meaning and context as the original audio or video to ensure all users can access the content.
