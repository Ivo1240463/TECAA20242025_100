## Sensory Characteristics

Instructions for understanding and interacting with content should not rely solely on sensory characteristics, such as color, shape, size, visual location, orientation, or sound. Many users may have sensory disabilities (e.g., color blindness, low vision, or hearing impairments), and relying on these characteristics could make the content inaccessible.

Instead, provide alternative ways to convey the necessary information that doesn't rely only on these sensory cues.

## General Rule

Instructions provided for understanding and operating content must not depend solely on sensory characteristics such as:

- Shape
- Color
- Size
- Visual location
- Orientation
- Sound

Alternative descriptions or instructions should be provided to ensure that all users can fully understand and interact with the content.

## Specific Situations

### Color Usage
Avoid using color alone to convey information. For example, don't require users to identify items based only on their color, like "Click the red button", without an additional description. Always provide textual clues like labels or descriptions alongside color.

### Shape or Size
If a button or link depends on its shape or size to convey meaning, ensure that additional information is provided to describe its function. For example, if the shape of a button is crucial to its function like, circular button means play, describe the action in text.

### Visual Location
If instructions refer to the location of an item for example, "click the top right button" include a more accessible alternative, such as a description or a reference to the buttonâ€™s label.

### Orientation or Movement
If the user is expected to rotate their device, move in a certain direction, or perform some other action based on orientation, include alternative instructions that don't rely on physical movement.

### Sound or Audio Cues
If instructions rely on sound for example, "listen for the beep", make sure there is a visual or textual alternative that has the same meaning. For instance, provide captions or visual indicators when sounds are used to carry important information.
