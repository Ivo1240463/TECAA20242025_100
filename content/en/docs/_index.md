## Introduction to WCAG Guidelines

The **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)** are a set of international standards developed by the W3C to ensure that digital content is accessible to all users, including people with disabilities. These guidelines help create a more inclusive web by removing barriers that could prevent users from perceiving, understanding, navigating, or interacting with online content.

### Importance of WCAG guidelines

Accessibility is not just a technical requirement, it is a matter of equality and inclusion. Millions of people rely on assistive technologies or alternative methods to access digital content.When websites follow accessibility best practices, they:

- Improve the user experience for everyone
- Ensure legal compliance in many regions
- Make content available to a broader audience
- Support ethical and inclusive design principles

By following WCAG, developers and designers contribute to a web that is open and usable for all.

### Levels of Conformance

WCAG is organized into three levels of conformance:

- Level A – The most basic web accessibility features, that is essential for all users.
- Level AA – Deals with the biggest and most common barriers for disabled users.
- Level AAA – The highest and most complex level of accessibility.

Each level builds upon the previous one, with Level A being the minimum requirement.

### Focus

This site focuses specifically on WCAG Level A guidelines under the Perceivable principle.

The Perceivable principle addresses how users can see and hear content, ensuring that information and interface elements are presented in ways that users can perceive, regardless of their abilities.

We'll explore each guideline under this principle, breaking down their intent, general rules, and real-world application so developers and content creators can easily apply them to their own work.
