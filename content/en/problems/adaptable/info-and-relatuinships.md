### Challenge:
Ensuring that relationships between elements (headings, lists, tables, labels, and form fields) are programmatically conveyed for assistive technologies.
### Detection Issues: 
Automated tools can detect missing semantic elements, but they may not catch incorrect nesting or improper label associations.
### Solution: 
Use automated tools like WAVE and axe DevTools to detect missing semantic structures, then manually review element relationships using screen readers and HTML inspection.
