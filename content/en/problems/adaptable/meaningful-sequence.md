### Challenge:
Ensuring that content remains readable and meaningful when CSS styling is removed or assistive technologies navigate sequentially.
### Detection Issues: 
Automated tools can flag improper tab order but cannot always determine whether the reading order is logical.
### Solution: 
Use tools like Accessibility Insights to check focus order, and manually disable CSS to ensure a coherent reading sequence.
