### Challenge:
Ensuring that instructions do not rely solely on sensory cues like color, shape, size, or location.
### Detection Issues: 
Automated tools can identify missing labels and color reliance but cannot verify if additional context is provided.
### Solution: 
Use WAVE to detect color-only instructions and conduct manual testing to ensure meaningful descriptions accompany visual cues.
