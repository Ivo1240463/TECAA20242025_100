### Challenge:
Ensuring that all non-text content, such as images, icons, charts, and multimedia, has a text alternative that conveys the same meaning.

### Detection Issues:
Automated tools can identify missing alt text but cannot assess the quality, accuracy, or appropriateness of the provided text alternatives.

### Solution:
Combine automated checks (e.g., WAVE, AXE) with manual review by accessibility experts to verify relevance and clarity.
