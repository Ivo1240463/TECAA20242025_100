### Challenge:
Ensuring that color is not the sole method of conveying meaning (e.g., errors, links, required fields).
### Detection Issues: 
Automated tools can detect missing contrast ratios and lack of additional indicators, but they cannot assess usability for color-blind users.
### Solution: 
Use WAVE and axe DevTools to flag color-dependent elements, then manually review for alternative indicators like text labels, patterns, or icons.
