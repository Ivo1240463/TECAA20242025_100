### Challenge: 
Ensuring that audio-only and video-only content has appropriate alternatives, such as transcripts for audio and descriptive text or captions for video.  

### Detection Issues: 
Automated tools may detect the absence of captions or transcripts but cannot evaluate their accuracy or relevance.  

### Solution: 
Use automated tools to check for missing captions and transcripts, combined with manual verification for quality and completeness.
